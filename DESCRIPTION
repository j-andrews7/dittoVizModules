Description: dittoVizModules offers a core selection of interactivity-first Shiny modules for dittoViz 
    plot types meant to serve as the base for more complex modules. These modules
    allow for the rapid and convenient construction of Shiny apps with very few lines
    of code and decouple plotting from the underlying data. As is, these modules allow 
    for full plot aesthetic customization by the end user through UI inputs. Utility
    functions for simple UI organization and parsing are also provided.
