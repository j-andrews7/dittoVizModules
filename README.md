# dittoVizModules

This package utilizes the [dittoViz](https://github.com/dtm2451/dittoViz) package to create interactivity-first Shiny modules for common plot types, designed to serve as building blocks for Shiny apps and as the basis for more complex/specialized modules.

It provides comprehensive plot control for app users, allowing for convenient aesthetic customizations and publication-quality images.
